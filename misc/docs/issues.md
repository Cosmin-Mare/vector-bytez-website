## Issues to fix
_____________________________________________________________

1) grayscale HC logo in the navbar, left to ours (the logo must be grayscale to match the overall design)
2) the content of pages
3) cow spots on the about page
4) the website's loading time (which at least for the home page is too slow)
5) all members should be added on the 'About' page
6) the portfolio page design needs to be done again because it's all very compartmentalized
7) make the carousel animation on the 'About' page to be infinite (it's not)

## Possible things to add
_____________________________________________________________
1) a 'Loading...' page while the pages are loading. like in a game
2) Better styling overall to make the pages look better - we could rethink the design to not allow it to be bigger then your screen (responsive) and to add smart animations that will make it look more like a game
3) the contact page looks pretty basic right now and it could look better. But, in the case of the entire website to look closer to a game, the contact page could look different. That could be improved when the overall design is changed
4) a mode to change between languages (English and Romanian)
5) a page that leads to all hackathons
6) a page for articles (meh...)
7) a page for sponsors
8) the HC logo in the nav to have an on-click link to lead to HC's main page
9) a page explaining the sakura tree's history and why we chose it as our symbol :))) 
                What is the story behind the Japanese cherry blossom tree?
                Cherry blossoms symbolize both birth and death, beauty and violence. They are a central motif in the Japanese worship of nature, but they have also historically signified the short but colorful life of the samurai. Sakura emblems also adorned the planes of kamikaze pilots during World War II.
